# Forward-Forward Learning of a Single Perceptron
Python code for applying the Forward-Forward Learning Algorithm to a Single Perceptron for classification of handwritten digits in the MNIST data set (requires PyTorch).

The Jupyter Notebook file also includes the text output during training of the perceptron with 8000 outputs.
